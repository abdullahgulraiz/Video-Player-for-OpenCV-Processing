# Video Player for OpenCV Processing
The Qt-based project allows a user to view results of OpenCV processing in parallel with the original video sample. The user can program different OpenCV processing (e.g. filters) to be applied to a running video, results of which can then be observed simultaneously with the original video. The aim of project is to serve as a base for other OpenCV Projects. 

The initial configuration allows for Segmenting a video in parallel with the original sample.
